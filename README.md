# A-simple-Cache-Simulator
A simple cache simulator to determine Instruction Cache miss, Data Cache miss and Combined miss with variable cache size, block size, associativity and cache Type for different trace and out file generated by  intel pin tool .

To Run the python file:
Enter the inputs in following order: cache size only integer(no kb),block size, associativity, cache type=1 for combined and 0 for split
Pass arguments as follows:"python main.py cacheSize blockSize associativity cacheType" (cacheSize is in kb)
For eg: python main.py 32 8 1 0
